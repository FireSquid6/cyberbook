# My Personal Notebook
I find that it's always a constant battle between having my notebook be convienient to start writing in, while also being organized. This website hopes to solve that problem.

## How it works
Every day, in a paginated physical notebook, you make a new section for that day. During that day, you write your notes in that section, disregarding topics.  

At the end of the day, you use this website to save short descriptions, tags, and page numbers of all the things you have written in your notebook that day. When you later need to access these, you simply have to use the search feature to search by tag and description. This means that you can quickly find and add notes.
