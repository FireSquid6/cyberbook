# Cyberbook
Cyberbook is an app built to help you organize your physical notebook. It allows you to write a description, date, notebook, and page number for physical notes you write down, and then search for them later. This is useful if you keep an engineering daybook.

# Contributing
Cyberbook is built with:

1. Clone the repo
2. Write into `.env.local` the firebase config (ask @firesquid6 on discord if you don't have it)
3. Run `npm install` to get the dependencies
4. Run `npm run dev` to start the development server

This project is very small, so I didn't bother writing unit tests. Jest is installed, so feel free to do so if you'd like.
